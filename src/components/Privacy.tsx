                Our Service is not intended for use by children under the age of 18 (or the relevant age of majority).
                We do not knowingly collect personal identifiable information from children under this age. If we become
                aware that we have collected personal data from a child without verification of parental consent, we
                take steps to remove that information from our servers.
