                <strong>1. Service Description</strong>
            </p>
            <p>WayMatcher is a platform designed to connect individuals for the purpose of carpooling. Users can:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Register for an account and manage their profile.</li>
                <li>Create &quot;Pilot&quot; events, offering rides to others.</li>
                <li>Create &quot;Passenger&quot; events, requesting rides from others.</li>
                <li>Search for and join existing carpooling events.</li>
                <li>Communicate with other users regarding carpooling arrangements.</li>
                <li>Rate other users based on their carpooling experience.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                WayMatcher acts as a facilitator to connect Pilots and Passengers. WayMatcher is not a transportation
                carrier and does not provide transportation services. We are not responsible for the actions, omissions,
                or conduct of any user, nor for the safety, quality, or legality of the carpooling arrangements made
                through the Service.

            <p>
                <strong>4. Event Creation and Participation</strong>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Pilot Responsibilities:</strong> If you create a Pilot event, you represent and warrant that
                    you are legally licensed to drive, possess valid vehicle insurance as required by law, and that your
                    vehicle is in safe operating condition. You are solely responsible for compliance with all
                    applicable traffic laws and regulations.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Passenger Responsibilities:</strong> If you join an event as a Passenger, you agree to
                    behave respectfully towards the Pilot and any other passengers, adhere to agreed-upon pickup times
                    and locations, and contribute to any agreed-upon costs (if applicable) in a timely manner.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Arrangements:</strong> All arrangements, including routes, times, costs (if any), and
                    meeting points, are made directly between the Pilot and Passenger(s). WayMatcher is not a party to
                    these arrangements.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Safety:</strong> Your safety is your responsibility. We encourage users to exercise caution
                    and common sense when arranging and participating in carpools. WayMatcher does not conduct
                    background checks on users. You interact with other users at your own risk.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Costs:</strong> Any cost-sharing arrangements are strictly between the Pilot and Passengers.
                    WayMatcher does not facilitate payments and is not responsible for any financial transactions
                    between users. Cost contributions should generally only cover the actual costs of the trip (fuel,
                    tolls, etc.) and should not result in profit for the Pilot, which could have legal and insurance
                    implications.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                <strong>5. User Ratings</strong>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The Service includes a rating system allowing users to provide feedback on their carpooling
                    experiences.
                </li>
                <li>You agree to provide honest and fair ratings based on your actual experiences.</li>
                <li>Ratings should not contain offensive, defamatory, or inappropriate language.</li>
                <li>
                    WayMatcher reserves the right to remove ratings that violate these Terms but is under no obligation
                    to do so.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
